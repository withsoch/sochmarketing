                  Restaurants, cafes and shisha lounges, starting with a pilot
                  in Tallinn, because a grill or a lounge needs its Google
                  listing and its Wolt menu handled properly, not a content
                  calendar borrowed from a software company.

              <p>
                Most social media services sell posts. They write content,
                schedule it, and call it done, one channel at a time. For a
                restaurant, that&apos;s rarely the real bottleneck. The
                bottleneck is a Google listing nobody claimed, reviews nobody
                answered, and a delivery menu with three photos and no
                best-sellers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The venues that fill up are not the ones posting the most.
                They&apos;re the ones that are easy to find, that answer
                their reviews the same day, and whose Wolt or Bolt Food
                listing actually sells the menu. That doesn&apos;t come from
                a content calendar alone. It comes from treating Google,
                reviews and delivery apps as seriously as the Instagram feed.
